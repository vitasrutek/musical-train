PD-SAP

Office documents (.docx and .xlsx) are not attached because of owners policy.

Simple app (but powerful for me) that can:
* create new project documentation item (folders)
* fill in item values in .docx and .xlxs
* watch deadline every item
* prepair project documentation for next processing
